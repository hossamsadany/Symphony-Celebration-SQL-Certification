# Symphony-Celebration-SQL-Certification
Certification quiz from Data Camp
# project Overview
The New York Philharmonic is one of America's largest orchestras. In honor of its many famous musicians, the director is planning a special event. She wants to hold a concert to celebrate the top soloists from its history. I have been asked to determine which soloists should receive recognition.
# Requirements

- The results should only include the top 1% of soloists calculated by the total number of concerts performed.

- Limit results to entries where the orchestra is 'New York Philharmonic' and the event type is 'Subscription Season'. Soloist performances in other orchestras or event types should not count towards the calculation of the top soloists.

- The director is only interested in individual soloists. she need to exclude all of the following soloists: 'Chorus', 'No Soloist', 'New York Choral Artists', and 'Schola Cantorum of NY'. I should also exclude any soloist with 'choir' in the name.

- The result should contain the following columns. It should meet all requirements as described.


| column |	Requirement|
| :---: | :---: |
| name	| The name of the soloist, with the first name followed by the last name (e.g., Jane Smith). Please note that in the soloists table, names are in reverse order (last name, first name).	| 
| first_date |The first date the soloist ever performed with the orchestra, in the format '01 Jan 2015' (i.e., day as an integer, short month name, and year as an integer).|
| last_date | The last date the soloist ever performed with the orchestra, in the format '01 Jan 2015' (i.e., day as an integer, short month name, and year as an integer).|
|total_concerts	|The total number of concerts the soloist performed|

- Order results by the total number of concerts performed in descending order, and then by soloist name in alphabetical order.
